# Carlos-Challenge-20-REACT-Portfolio

This is my attempt at reacrerating my portfolio from the Week 2 Challenge but using REACT and any other assets we learned from the previous weeks. This however is still a work in progress.

For this project, I have been researching and referring to numerous sources for ways on how to work around REACT and create the pieces necessary for this project.
